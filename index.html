            <span>Hayao Miyazaki</span> (宮崎 駿, Miyazaki Hayao, born 5 January
            1941) is a Japanese animator, director, producer, screenwriter,
            author, and manga artist. A co-founder of Studio Ghibli, he has
            attained international acclaim as a masterful storyteller and
            creator of animated feature films, and is widely regarded as one of
            the most accomplished filmmakers in the history of animation.
          </p>
          <p class="bio-text text--size">
            Miyazaki co-founded Studio Ghibli in 1985. He directed numerous
            films with Ghibli, including Castle in the Sky (1986), My Neighbor
            Totoro (1988), Kiki's Delivery Service (1989), and Porco Rosso
            (1992). The films were met with critical and commercial success in
            Japan.
          </p>
          <p class="bio-text text--size">
            His 2001 film Spirited Away became the highest-grossing film in
            Japanese history, winning the Academy Award for Best Animated
            Feature at the 75th Academy Awards, and is frequently ranked among
            the greatest films of the 2000s. Miyazaki's later films—Howl's
            Moving Castle (2004), Ponyo (2008), and The Wind Rises (2013)—also
            enjoyed critical and commercial success. Following the release of
            The Wind Rises, Miyazaki announced his retirement from feature
            films, though he returned to work on the upcoming feature film How
            Do You Live? in 2016.

          Many of my movies have strong female leads—brave, self-sufficient
          girls that don't think twice about fighting for what they believe with
          all their heart. They'll need a friend, or a supporter, but never a
          savior. Any woman is just as capable of being a hero as any man.
